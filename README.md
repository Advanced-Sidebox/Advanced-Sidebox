*A plugin for MyBB forums that displays custom boxes on various forum pages.*

This plugin seeks to give the admin more options when adding side boxes to the forum and allow control in a more intuitive way. This plugin edits the template cache and does not modify your forum's templates-- therefore it does not work with every theme but *is* designed to work with most.

## GitHub Page

[Advanced Sidebox GitHub Page](http://wildcardsearch.github.com/Advanced-Sidebox) can be found here and provides a quick way to see what is going on with the project and to download the latest version.

## Features

* Admin can control many settings for where and how side boxes display
* Choose one of many default presets with updated content or create semi-static custom boxes with HTML and template variables
* Import/Export custom boxes to share and backup your work
* 1.4 currently in testing!
